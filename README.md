a. What is an issue?
An issue is a versatile item which can be created to track work on GitHub, collaborate in teams, and manage projects.

b. What is a pull request?
Pull requests are used to merge changes between branches and allow teams to look through and discuss proposed changes before implementing the code changes to the project.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
Pull requests can be opened on the repository main page in GitHub. Once the respective branch is selected, select the "pull requests" tab and select "compare & pull request" to open the pull request for that branch.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
Step 1 - Open the main page of the repository
Step 2 - Click "Settings" on the far right and click "Collaborators" at the top left of the next screen. This will give you the option to manage the repository (public vs private setting) and add people to grant direct access. 
Step 3 - Click "add people" and search by username, full name, or email to add their github account as a collaborator 
Step 4 - Select the github profile you want to add to your repository as a collaborator and click "Add PROFILE to repository" 

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control tool used for projects which allows users to build a version history. Multiple users can access and clone project code and work toward project completion on their local computers simultaneously. GitHub is a cloud-based platform which uses Git software and allows users to store their code in repositories for easy sharing and tracking.  

f. What does git diff do?
git diff allows the user to track changes between files. It indicates the line number which was changed as well as a change summary for what content was changed.

g. What is the main branch?


h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
